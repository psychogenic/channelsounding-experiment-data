# channelsounding-experiment-data

Data collected during channel sounding experiments.


While investigating bluetooth 6 channel sounding, I performed 3 experiments, the data for which is provided here (along with some results).

All three were performed outdoors:

  1) The ["free space"](./freespace_experiment/) test aimed to look at variance between estimation methods and individual measurements;
  
  2) The [walk in the park](./park_experiment1/) was looking at reported value accuracy; and
  
  3) In [plane to see](./park_experiment2/), two reflectors were used to try and determine 2D position using two reflectors
  
The data are just dumps from the serial console of the channel sounding initiator, and included here raw to preserve a log of how much actual disruption was encountered (e.g. disconnects etc), even if these are ignored in the analysis of the measurements.


These are demonstrated in a video that will be released shortly, and linked here when it is published.
